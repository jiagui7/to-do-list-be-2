# to-do-list-be-2

The API has been developed using Visual Studio Code, so the way to set it up or run the tests could be a little bit different.

## Run project

Using `.NET Core Tools`, just need to go to `To-Do-List.csproj` file in VS Code, right click on the file in the explorer view and click on "Run .NET Core project".

## Run tests

To run the tests, I've used `.NET Core Test Explorer` extension.

### Setup

We need to link the extension with the tests folder path. So, if you open VS Code preferences and go to Extensions > .NET Core Test Explorer and set the `Test Project Path` to "Task" should link the project.

### Run

To run the test, I've used the tests extension clicking the play button.
